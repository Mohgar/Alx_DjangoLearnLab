## Permissions

In this application, the following custom permissions have been defined:

- `can_create`: Allows users to create new objects.
- `can_edit`: Allows users to edit existing objects.
- `can_delete`: Allows users to delete objects.
- `can_view`: Allows users to view objects.

These permissions are assigned to specific groups as needed.

## Groups

The following groups have been created to manage user access:

- **Editors**: Users in this group have the `can_edit` and `can_view` permissions.
- **Creators**: Users in this group have the `can_create` and `can_view` permissions.
- **Managers**: Users in this group have the `can_create`, `can_edit`, `can_delete`, and `can_view` permissions.

1. **Create the Custom Permissions**:
    ```python
   
    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ('can_view', 'Can View'),
            ('can_create', 'Can Create'),
            ('can_edit', 'Can Edit'),
            ('can_delete', 'Can Delete'),
        ]
   


2. **Create the Groups and Assign Permissions**:
    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.models import Group

    # Create Groups
    editors_group = Group.objects.create(name='Editors')
    creators_group = Group.objects.create(name='Creators')
    managers_group = Group.objects.create(name='Managers')

    # Assign Permissions to Groups
    editors_group.permissions.add(can_edit, can_view)
    creators_group.permissions.add(can_create, can_view)
    managers_group.permissions.add(can_create, can_edit, can_delete, can_view)
    ```

3. **Assign Users to Groups**:
    ```python
    user = CustomUser.objects.get(username='username')
    user.groups.add(editors_group)
